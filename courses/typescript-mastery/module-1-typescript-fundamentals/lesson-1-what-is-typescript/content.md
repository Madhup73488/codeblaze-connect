**Objective:** Understand why TypeScript was created and the core benefits it provides over plain JavaScript.

**Topics:**

*   TypeScript as a "superset" of JavaScript.
*   The concept of static typing vs. dynamic typing.
*   Key benefits: Catching errors early, improved autocompletion and IntelliSense, code self-documentation.
*   The role of the TypeScript Compiler (TSC).

**Example (Concept):**
In JavaScript, you might write `const result = myVar / someObj;` and only discover at runtime that `someObj` is not a number. TypeScript allows you to catch this error during development by knowing the types of `myVar` and `someObj` beforehand.

**Practice Problem:**
In your own words, explain the difference between a "static type system" and a "dynamic type system". What is one major advantage of a static type system?
