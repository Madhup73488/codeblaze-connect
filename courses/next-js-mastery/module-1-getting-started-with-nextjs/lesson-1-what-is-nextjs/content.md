**Objective:** Understand the purpose of Next.js and its key features.

**Topics:**

*   What Next.js is (The React Framework for the Web).
*   Problems it solves (Routing, Rendering, Performance).
*   Key Features: App Router, Server Components, Built-in Optimizations.
*   Comparison with Create React App (CRA).

**Example (Concept):**
Instead of setting up React Router, Webpack, and Babel manually, Next.js provides a production-ready framework with these tools pre-configured, allowing you to focus on building features.

**Practice Problem:**
List three specific advantages of using Next.js over a client-side only React application created with Create React App.
