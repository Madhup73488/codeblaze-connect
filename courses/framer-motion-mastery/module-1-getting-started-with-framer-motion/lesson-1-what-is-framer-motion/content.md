**Objective:** Understand what Framer Motion is and why it's a powerful tool for creating animations in React.

**Topics:**

*   The declarative approach to animation.
*   Key features: Production-ready animations, gestures, server-side rendering compatibility.
*   How it simplifies complex animations compared to CSS transitions or other libraries.

**Example (Concept):**
Instead of writing complex CSS keyframes and transitions, you can define the start and end states of an animation directly on a component, and Framer Motion will handle the rest. For example, moving an element is as simple as changing `x: 0` to `x: 100`.

**Practice Problem:**
Think about an animation on a website you admire (e.g., a modal window appearing, a card flipping). Describe the different states of that animation (initial, animated, exit).
