### Topics

- Key directives in redis.conf.
- Securing Redis with requirepass.
- Disabling dangerous commands like FLUSHALL in production.
- Network security (binding to localhost).

### Example (redis.conf directive)

```bash
# Sets a password that clients must use to connect
requirepass your-very-secure-password
```

### Practice Problem

Why is it a bad idea to expose a Redis server directly to the public internet, even with a password?
