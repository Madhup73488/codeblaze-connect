### Topics

- The problem with long-running tasks in a web request-response cycle.
- Synchronous vs. Asynchronous execution.
- The role of a task queue in offloading work.
- Common Use Cases: Sending emails, processing images/videos, generating reports, calling third-party APIs.

### Example (Concept)

When a user signs up, instead of making them wait while your server sends a welcome email, you add an "send_email" task to a queue. The server immediately responds "Success!", and a separate background process (a Celery worker) picks up the task and sends the email without blocking the user.

### Practice Problem

List three different operations on a modern e-commerce website (e.g., Amazon) that are likely handled by a background task queue.
