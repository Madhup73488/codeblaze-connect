# Lesson 1.1: Introduction to React and Component-Based Architecture

*   **What is React.js?**
    *   React is a free and open-source frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It's maintained by Meta (Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
    *   **Not a Framework:** React is often called a "library" because it only handles the UI layer. You need other libraries for routing, state management, etc. (which is why frameworks like Next.js or Remix build upon React).
    *   **Declarative:** You describe what you want the UI to look like, and React figures out how to render it efficiently.
    *   **Component-Based:** UIs are broken down into small, isolated, reusable pieces called components.
    *   **"Learn Once, Write Anywhere":** React can be used for web (React DOM), mobile (React Native), and even desktop applications.
*   **Why React is Popular (and its advantages)**
    *   **Component Reusability:** Build once, use everywhere. This leads to faster development and consistent UIs.
    *   **Virtual DOM:** React uses a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM, efficiently calculates the minimal changes needed, and then updates only those parts of the real DOM. This optimizes performance.
    *   **Declarative Nature:** Makes code easier to read and debug.
    *   **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data flows in one direction, making state changes predictable.
    *   **Strong Community and Ecosystem:** Vast resources, libraries, and tools available.
*   **Setting up a React Project (Create React App)**
    *   Create React App (CRA) is a tool built by Facebook to set up a new React project quickly with a sensible default configuration (bundling, transpiling, hot reloading, etc.) without needing to configure complex build tools like Webpack directly.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Ensure Node.js and npm/Yarn are installed.
        2.  Create a new React app: `npx create-react-app my-react-app`
        3.  `# OR with Yarn:`
        4.  `# yarn create react-app my-react-app`
        5.  Navigate into the project directory: `cd my-react-app`
        6.  Start the development server: `npm start`
        7.  `# OR`
        8.  `# yarn start`
        9.  This will typically open your app in the browser at http://localhost:3000.
*   **Project Structure (Overview of a CRA project)**
    *   `node_modules/`: Installed packages.
    *   `public/`: Static assets (index.html, favicon.ico). index.html is the root HTML file where your React app is injected.
    *   `src/`: Your main source code.
        *   `App.js`: Main component.
        *   `index.js`: Entry point for React DOM. Renders App.js into public/index.html.
        *   `App.css`, `index.css`: Stylesheets.
        *   `logo.svg`, `reportWebVitals.js`, `setupTests.js`: Other boilerplate files.
    *   `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.
*   **Understanding index.html and index.js (The Entry Point)**
    *   `public/index.html`:
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <!-- ... meta tags ... -->
            <title>React App</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
            <div id="root"></div> <!-- This is where your React app gets injected -->
            <!-- Your JavaScript bundles are automatically injected here by CRA -->
          </body>
        </html>
        ```
    *   `src/index.js`:
        ```javascript
        import React from 'react';
        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; // Import from client
        import './index.css'; // Global styles
        import App from './App'; // Your main App component

        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
        root.render(
          <React.StrictMode>
            <App />
          </React.StrictMode>
        );
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** `ReactDOM.createRoot` is the new way to create a root for your React app. `root.render()` tells React to display the `<App />` component inside the HTML element with id="root".
*   **Exercise: Create Your First React App**
    1.  Using `npx create-react-app my-first-react-app`, set up a new React project.
    2.  Navigate into the project and run `npm start`. Verify the default React app runs in your browser.
    3.  Open `src/App.js` and `src/index.js`. Understand how `App.js` is imported and rendered into the root element.
    4.  Change the text inside the `<h1>` tag in `App.js` to "Hello, React from [Your Name]!". Save and observe the live update in the browser.
