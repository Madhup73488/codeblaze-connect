**Objective:** Understand the "utility-first" philosophy and its advantages over traditional CSS or component frameworks like Bootstrap.

**Topics:**

*   What is a utility-first framework?
*   The problem with traditional CSS (naming conventions, file size, context switching).
*   How Tailwind solves these problems.
*   Comparing Tailwind to BEM or component-based CSS frameworks.

**Example (Concept):**
Instead of creating a class `.card` with multiple CSS properties, you build the card's style directly in the HTML by composing utility classes like `p-6`, `bg-white`, `rounded-lg`, and `shadow-md`.

**Practice Problem:**
Look at a simple button on any website. Try to describe its styling (padding, background color, text color, border radius) using conceptual utility classes, like you would with Tailwind.
