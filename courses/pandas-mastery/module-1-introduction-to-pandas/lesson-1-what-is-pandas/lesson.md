### Topics

- Why pandas? (Handling tabular data in Python).
- The two primary data structures: Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D).
- Key features: Data alignment, handling missing data, powerful grouping.

### Example (Concept)

If Python's list of lists is like a basic spreadsheet, a pandas DataFrame is like an advanced spreadsheet application (like Excel or Google Sheets) built directly into your code, with powerful, fast tools for sorting, filtering, and analyzing data.

### Practice Problem

Describe the difference between a pandas Series and a DataFrame. What kind of real-world data would be suitable for each?
