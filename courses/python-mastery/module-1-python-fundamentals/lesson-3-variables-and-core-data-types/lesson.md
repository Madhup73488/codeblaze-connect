### Topics

- Variables and assignment.
- Data Types: Integers (int), Floating-Point Numbers (float), Strings (str), Booleans (bool).
- Type casting (e.g., int(), str()).
- Working with strings: f-strings, methods (.upper(), .lower(), .strip()).

### Example (Variables and f-string)

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.5
is_active = True

# Using an f-string for formatted output
print(f"User: {name}, Age: {age}, Active: {is_active}")
```

### Practice Problem

Create a variable to store the price of an item (19.99) and another for the quantity (3). Calculate the total cost and store it in a new variable. Print the result in a user-friendly sentence using an f-string.
