### Topics

- for loops for iterating over sequences (lists, strings, ranges).
- while loops for repeating as long as a condition is true.
- break to exit a loop early.
- continue to skip to the next iteration.

### Example (A for loop)

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}s.")
```

### Practice Problem

Write a while loop that counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints "Liftoff!".
