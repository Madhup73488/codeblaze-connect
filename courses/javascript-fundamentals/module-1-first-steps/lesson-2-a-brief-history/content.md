### Lesson 1.2: A Brief History: From Mocha to a Global Standard
<p>The story of JavaScript is a fascinating tale of rapid development, corporate competition, and eventual standardization that propelled it to become the ubiquitous language of the web. Its journey was not a carefully planned, years-long project but a whirlwind of creation driven by the urgent needs of the early internet.</p>

<h4>The Birth at Netscape</h4>
<p>The language was born in May 1995 when Brendan Eich, a newly hired developer at Netscape Communications, created the first version in just ten days. Netscape, the company behind the dominant browser of the era, Netscape Navigator, recognized that the web needed to move beyond static HTML pages. They envisioned a "language for the masses" that would allow web designers and part-time programmers to easily add interactivity to their sites.</p>
<p>Initially, the language was named <strong>Mocha</strong>. It was then briefly renamed <strong>LiveScript</strong> before being officially launched as <strong>JavaScript</strong> in December 1995. The name change was a strategic marketing decision made in partnership with Sun Microsystems, whose Java programming language was extremely popular at the time. By naming it "JavaScript," Netscape hoped to position it as a scripting companion to Java, capitalizing on Java's popularity. This naming has caused confusion ever since, but it's crucial to understand that, apart from some superficial syntactic similarities, <strong>JavaScript and Java are entirely different and unrelated languages</strong>.</p>

<h4>Standardization and the Browser Wars</h4>
<p>Following JavaScript's release, Microsoft quickly entered the fray during the "Browser Wars." They reverse-engineered JavaScript to create their own implementation for Internet Explorer, calling it <strong>JScript</strong>. However, JScript had noticeable differences from Netscape's JavaScript. This divergence created a significant problem for developers: code that worked in Netscape Navigator might break in Internet Explorer, and vice versa.</p>
<p>To solve this crisis of incompatibility, Netscape submitted JavaScript to <strong>Ecma International</strong>, a standards organization. This led to the official release of the first <strong>ECMAScript (ES)</strong> language specification in June 1997. ECMAScript is the official name of the standard, while JavaScript is the most well-known implementation of that standard. Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint that defines the language's features and syntax, and JavaScript as the actual engine built according to that blueprint. Since then, the language has undergone numerous revisions, with new versions (ES6/ES2015, ES2018, etc.) adding significant new features.</p>

<h4>Modern JavaScript's Dominance</h4>
<p>Two major developments in the late 2000s cemented JavaScript's modern dominance:</p>

    <li><strong>High-Performance Engines:</strong> In 2008, Google released the Chrome browser with its open-source <strong>V8 JavaScript engine</strong>. V8 was a turning point, offering a massive leap in performance through techniques like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. This made it possible for developers to build sophisticated, application-like experiences in the browser.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript Beyond the Browser:</strong> In 2009, Ryan Dahl used the V8 engine to create <strong>Node.js</strong>, an environment that allowed JavaScript to run <em>outside</em> of a web browser, on servers. This was a revolutionary development, allowing developers to use a single language for both the front-end and the back-end (full-stack development).</li>
