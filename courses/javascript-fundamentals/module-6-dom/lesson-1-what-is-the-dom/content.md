### Lesson 6.1: What is the DOM?
<p>The <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> is a browser API that represents an HTML document as a tree of objects (nodes). JavaScript can interact with this tree to dynamically change a webpage's content, structure, and style.</p>
<p>The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language itself; it's a web API that JavaScript can access, most commonly through the global <code class="prose-inline-code">document</code> object.</p>
