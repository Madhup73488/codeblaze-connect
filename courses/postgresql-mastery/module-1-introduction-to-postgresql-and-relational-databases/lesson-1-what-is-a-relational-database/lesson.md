### Topics

- The Relational Model: Tables, Rows (Tuples), and Columns (Attributes).
- Structured vs. Unstructured Data.
- Introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language).
- SQL vs. NoSQL: Key differences, pros, and cons.

### Example (Concept)

A spreadsheet is a simple analogy for a database table. Each row is a unique record (like a specific customer), and each column is an attribute of that record (like first_name, last_name, email).

### Practice Problem

Think about a simple blog. What different "entities" (like Users, Posts, Comments) would you need? What "attributes" (columns) would each entity have?
