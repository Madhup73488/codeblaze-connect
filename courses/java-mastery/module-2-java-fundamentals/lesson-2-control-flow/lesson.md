- Conditional Statements: if, else if, else.
- The switch statement.
- Loops: for, while, do-while.
- break and continue keywords.

### Example (A for loop)

```java
public class Loops {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration number: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

### Practice Problem

Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop and an if statement.
