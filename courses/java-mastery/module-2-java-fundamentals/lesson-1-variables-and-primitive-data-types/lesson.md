### Topics

- Declaring and initializing variables.
- Primitive Types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.
- The String class (a special case).
- Type casting.

### Example (Variables and Primitives)

```java
public class Variables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 25;
        double price = 19.99;
        char grade = 'A';
        boolean isActive = true;
        String name = "John Doe";

        System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
```

### Practice Problem

Declare variables to store the number of wheels on a car, the price of a coffee, and the first initial of your name. Print all three variables to the console.
