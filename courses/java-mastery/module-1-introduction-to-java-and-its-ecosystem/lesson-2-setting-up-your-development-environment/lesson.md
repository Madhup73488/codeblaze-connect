### Topics

- Installing an OpenJDK distribution (e.g., Adoptium Temurin).
- Setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): IntelliJ IDEA vs. Eclipse vs. VS Code.
- Installing and configuring an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended).

### Example (Verifying installation)

```bash
# Open your terminal or command prompt after installation
java -version
javac -version
(Both commands should print the version of the installed JDK)
```

### Practice Problem

Install the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version of the JDK on your system. Then, install the Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA and create a new project.
