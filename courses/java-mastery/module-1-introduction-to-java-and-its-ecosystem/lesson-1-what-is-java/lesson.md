### Topics

- Java as a compiled, statically-typed, object-oriented language.
- The "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy.
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Development Kit (JDK).
- The role of bytecode.

### Example (Concept)

You write your Java code (.java file), the JDK's compiler turns it into bytecode (.class file). This bytecode is not specific to any OS. The JVM on any machine (Windows, Mac, Linux) can then interpret this same bytecode and run your program. This is how Java achieves platform independence.

### Practice Problem

In your own words, explain the difference between the JDK and the JRE. Which one would a user who only wants to run a Java application need? Which one does a developer need?
