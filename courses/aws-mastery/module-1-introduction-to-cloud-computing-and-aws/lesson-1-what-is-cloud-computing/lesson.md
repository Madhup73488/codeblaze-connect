### Topics

- The definition of cloud computing (on-demand delivery of IT resources).
- The Six Advantages of Cloud Computing (e.g., trade capital expense for variable expense).
- Service Models: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service).
- Deployment Models: Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud.

### Example (Concept)

IaaS (like AWS EC2) is like leasing a plot of land where you can build anything you want. PaaS (like AWS Elastic Beanstalk) is like renting a house where the foundation and utilities are managed for you. SaaS (like Gmail) is a complete, ready-to-use product.

### Practice Problem

Categorize the following services as IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS: 1. A virtual server you rent to host a custom application. 2. A managed database service. 3. A project management web application.
