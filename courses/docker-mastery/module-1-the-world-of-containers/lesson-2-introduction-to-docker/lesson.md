### Topics

- The Docker Engine (Client-Server architecture).
- Docker Images: The blueprints for containers.
- Docker Containers: The running instances of images.
- Docker Hub & Registries: Storing and sharing images.

### Example (Concept)

A Docker Image is like a cookie cutter (a recipe and a shape). A Docker Container is the actual cookie you create with that cutter. You can create many identical cookies (containers) from one cookie cutter (image).

### Practice Problem

In your own words, explain the relationship between a Docker Image and a Docker Container. Can you have one without the other?
