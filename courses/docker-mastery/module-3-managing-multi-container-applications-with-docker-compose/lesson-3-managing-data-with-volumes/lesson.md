objective: "To persist data generated by containers and share code for live development."

### Topics

- The problem of stateless containers.
- Volumes for persisting database data.
- Bind mounts for mounting host directories into containers (e.g., for live code reloading).
- Named volumes vs. bind mounts.

### Example (Persisting Postgres data)

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### Practice Problem

Modify your Node.js application's Compose service to use a bind mount. This should mount your local source code directory into the container's /app directory, allowing you to see code changes without rebuilding the image.
