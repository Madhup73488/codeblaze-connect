# Project Progress

The project is in a stable state after a period of rapid development and bug fixing. All major features have been implemented, and the application is fully functional.

## What Works

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out. The authentication state is managed by the `AuthContext` and persists across sessions.
- **Course and Internship Enrollment:** Users can enroll in courses and internship programs.
- **Progress Tracking:** User progress is tracked and stored in the backend. The `useProgress` hook provides a simple way to access and update user progress.
- **Lesson Content:** Lesson content is rendered correctly, with support for markdown and syntax highlighting.
- **Profile Management:** Users can view and update their profiles.
- **Responsive Layout:** The application is fully responsive and works well on all devices.

## What's Left to Build

- **Admin Dashboard:** An admin dashboard for managing courses, internships, and users.
- **Payment Integration:** Integration with a payment gateway to allow users to purchase courses.
- **Advanced Reporting:** More detailed reporting and analytics for users and admins.

## Known Issues

- All known issues have been resolved.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Authentication:** The authentication flow has been refined to use `js-cookie` for token storage and `localStorage` for user progress.
- **Data Fetching:** The data fetching process has been refactored to use a centralized `api` utility and individual `metadata.json` files for internship data.
- **UI Components:** The UI components have been improved to create a more polished and consistent look and feel.
- **Layout:** The layout has been refactored to use a collapsible sidebar and a focus mode for lesson pages.
