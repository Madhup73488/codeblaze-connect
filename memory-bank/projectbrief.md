# Project Brief

This project is a full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) designed to provide a comprehensive and engaging learning experience. The application allows users to enroll in courses and structured internship programs, track their progress, and manage their profiles.

The frontend is built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, featuring a responsive, component-based architecture. The backend is powered by **Supabase**, which handles user authentication, database services, and API endpoints. Course and internship data is primarily managed through a file-based system within the project structure.
