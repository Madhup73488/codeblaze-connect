The login page has been implemented on the frontend and is now connected to the backend running on port 5000. The `apiClient` has been updated to reflect the new backend URL. The root layout has been updated to conditionally render the sidebar based on the user's authentication status, and the middleware has been updated to correctly handle route protection. The `AuthContext` has been updated to use `js-cookie` for storing the authentication token. The issue with redirection after login has been resolved by updating the `AuthContext`, `LoginForm`, and `middleware` to correctly handle the redirection. The `Layout` component has been refactored into its own file to prevent re-rendering issues.
