# System Patterns

The application follows a component-based architecture, with a clear separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data layers. The UI is built with React and Next.js, and the data is stored in a file-based system. The application uses a custom `useProgress` hook to manage user progress and a `course-loader` utility to load course data.
